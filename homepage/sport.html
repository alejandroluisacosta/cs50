        <h3>The mystery is solved: my favorite sport of the moment is... Pádel!</h3>

            "Pádel" is a racket sport where the ball can hit the walls of the court (see image above) and your objective is to
            win points just as you do in tennis: if the ball hits your opponent's side floor twice or if they fail to make it hit
            on your side of the floor, you win the point.
        </p>

            The rackets are hard and the game it's pretty fast, so it's incredibly fun to play. I started playing in 2021 and, ever since,
            I've become a huge fan of it!
