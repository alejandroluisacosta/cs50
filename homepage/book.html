            I'm a big (big!) fan of self help, and even tho many people say it's useless, I find it not only useful, but fascinating.

            <i>La revolución de la autoestima</i> is a massive compilation of insights, insights I've acquired through my years reading
            and listening to outstanding people who talk about self-developement, self-awareness, happiness, the nature of consciousness,
            business, money, evolution, psychology, sex, and maaany other interesting topics.

                  It's about a machine that comes from the future and has only two abilities: to bring knowledge from his epoch and to induce "learning-by-experience states." When it arrives in 2021, two mediocre guys find it, and when the rich and powerful of the world get to know of its existence <i>and</i> the possibility that all humanity can become less dependant on junk products, social media, and goverments, things start to get, well... A bit crazy.

                  First of all: the tranquility that you don't need to finish it to understand it. Even though the story is fun to read, what's actually interesting are the lessons and dialogs between the characters and the narrator. Second, you'll learn a bunch of stuff I learned over the years by reading books and listening to psychologists, entrepreneurs, scientists, artists and smart people from very different environments. Also, you might laugh from time to time, but I can't promise you will.
